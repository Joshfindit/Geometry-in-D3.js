The work that geometers have done is fascinating...

Now that we have the technology to draw mathematically precise vectors, we are standing fresh at the kind of kinesthetic and tactile mathematical exploration that inspired [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid), [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Thābit ibn Qurra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thābit_ibn_Qurra), [Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes), and [so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler) other [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) [giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci) whose shoulders we stand on.

Whether combining vectors, programming, and geometry is a way to pass the time, something you're drawn to, a way to learn programming, a challenge, or even serious work, let this be the notice that ***this information is open for discussion, debate, and community.***
