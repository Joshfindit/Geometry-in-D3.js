I'm a kinaesthetic learner who is interested in the underlying principles of things.
Curiosity often leads me down rabbit holes, and seems to waste a lot of time.

It's rare to connect with people over these types of things, so I'm choosing to openly teach as much as possible, as a way of paying forward for all those who have shared much more than I ever could.

###If you find anything worth debating, bring it to my attention: ego is a barrier to knowledge, and it needs to be broken through regularly
