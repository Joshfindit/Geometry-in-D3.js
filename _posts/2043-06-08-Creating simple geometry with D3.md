There was a time when geometry was a way of exploring the world around us.

We understood the relationships between things in nature, we learned how we could fit together simple building blocks in to structures that still stand today, and we took our first steps in understanding math without having to first build a system of numbers.

###Now, as we continue to create layers of abstraction, we sometimes get away from the simple structure underneath...

Using only a straight edge, a writing tool, and a compass or string, the first explorers of this discipline set the groundwork for everyone that came after them.

For the sake of spurring creativity through constraints, I'm going to keep the examples and posts to only those tools:

* A straight edge for lines and for measuring
* A 'compass' for creating circles

And, as we build on the previous examples, we'll bring in shortcuts.
